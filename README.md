# NumNet
🧠 Model: Basic feedforward neural network implemented from scratch for MNIST digit classification.

📊 Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixel images flattened)

🔮 Hidden layer: Single layer with customizable number of neurons (e.g., 128 or 256)

🔢 Output layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit 0-9)

🔗 Activation functions: ReLU for hidden layer, softmax for output layer

🧮 Implementation: Uses only numpy for matrix operations and Python for logic

📚 Training: Utilizes mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation

🔍 Forward pass: Matrix multiplications and activation functions applied sequentially

🔄 Backward pass: Gradients computed using chain rule, weights updated accordingly

📏 Evaluation: Accuracy on test set is 82.5%

🚀 Advantages: Simplicity, full control over implementation, deep understanding of neural network mechanics

🔧 Challenges: Requires careful initialization and learning rate tuning, may converge slowly
